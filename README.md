### Installation :

Simply drop the latest .jar into the /plugins directory of your server.

### Documentation & Usage

Unfortunately there is no documentation for Radio at the moment. The plugin is still in development, and as such the features and capabilities are highly volatile. It is simpler to just get the plugin and play around with it on a testing server.
